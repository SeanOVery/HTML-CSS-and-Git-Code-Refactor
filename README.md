# Horiseon SEO Refactor

## Summary

The primary goal of this project is to refactor Horiseon's HTML to be more friendly to accesibility software.

Alongside that primary goal, some cleanup work was done on the code in general. Within the CSS primarily but also the HTML.

------------

## Details

* HTML tags converted from `<div>` to semantic elements for accesibility.
* Alt attributes added to images and icons in HTML for accesibility.
* CSS also updated to properly affect the new semantic tags.
* Unnecessary CSS selectors removed and/or simplified.
